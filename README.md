# Laptop

This is a fork of [thoughtbot/laptop](<https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop>) modified for my personal laptop setup.

Laptop is a script to set up a macOS laptop for web and mobile development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Requirements

We support:

* macOS Sequoia (15.x) on Apple Silicon and Intel
* macOS Sonoma (14.x) on Apple Silicon and Intel
* macOS Ventura (13.x) on Apple Silicon and Intel
* macOS Monterey (12.x) on Apple Silicon and Intel

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czeise/laptop/main/mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```

[Install dotfiles][dotfiles].

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/czeise/dotfiles#install

## Debugging

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

## Customize in `~/.laptop.local`

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.

### Testing your changes

Test your changes by running the script on a fresh install of macOS.
You can use the free and open source emulator [UTM].

Tip: Make a fresh virtual machine with the installation of macOS completed and
your user created and first launch complete. Then duplicate that machine to test
the script each time on a fresh install thats ready to go.
